            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>MonoDirector is BONELAB's first movie production mod. It first started out as a
                camera utility for BONEWORKS. Its features were limited at the time, and some 
                of those have been used to make a couple of trailers for BONEWORKS mods.
            </p>
            <p>Now, it has been shaped to become an all-in-one video creation utility.
                You can record yourself re-enacting a battle, a fist fight, a deadly car chase,
                and more.
