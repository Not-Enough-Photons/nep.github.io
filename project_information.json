It first started out as a camera utility for BONEWORKS.\nIts features were limited at the time, and some of those have been used to make a couple of trailers for BONEWORKS mods.\nNow, it has been shaped to become an all-in-one video creation utility. Record your favorite scene from your show or movie, or make something original. Make a shoot-out, a brawl, a race, anything. MonoDirector makes it possible."
