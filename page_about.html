            <p>Not Enough Photons is a modding thing that I, adamdev, made in late 2020.</p>
            <p>Our mods are pretty much just experiments. Experiments that attempt to bring something new and interesting.</p>
            <p>Since 2020, and so forth, we've been hard at work with new ideas. Some of them take longer, while others take
                less time.</p>
            <p>On our projects page, you can learn about our various works!</p>
            <p>p.s. when I say we, I mean it like there's only one person here :p</p>
