            <hr>
            <p>Not Enough Photons was founded by me, adamdev, or just Adam.
                It mostly is a solo effort, where I am the only one that develops
                the mods, games, and even the stuff you are seeing on this website.
            </p>
            <p>The name came from a random thought I had when I came up with an idea
                for a game. I wanted to make a developer name up. Something that will
                be new to me, and memorable. Not Enough Photons came about one night
                while I was in the kitchen of my house, and I ran with it ever since.
            </p>
            <p>Most of the work is done by my own hands, but I also tend to get
                other hands to help out to make projects that needs to be done!
